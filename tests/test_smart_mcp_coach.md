- Risk: CRITICAL ("authentication")
- Decision: STRONGLY_RECOMMEND /sm:introspect

**Expected Coaching:**
```
⚠️ **Major Change Detected: Question First**

**What you're planning:** "Rewrite the entire authentication system from scratch"

- Complexity: MEDIUM ("optimize")
- Risk: MEDIUM ("dashboard")
- Keyword: "optimize" (improvement without measurement)
- Decision: SUGGEST /sm:audit

**Expected Coaching:**
```
📊 **Measure First, Improve Second**

Before optimizing, let's establish a baseline:

[Show past data about measured vs unmeasured improvements]

- Decision: SUGGEST (learn from past)

**Expected Coaching:**
```
💡 **Found: Similar Past Solutions**

**Your current task:** "Implement rate limiting for API"

**From project memory (Chroma):**

[Show past solution #1: Redis + token bucket - SUCCESS]
[Show past solution #2: In-memory - FAILURE]
[Key lesson: Use Redis, avoid in-memory]
[Time savings: 3-4 hours]

[Offer Yes/No/Show Details options]
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Chroma match triggers "learn from past" principle

**User Input:** "Update the button styling on the login page"

**Expected Detection:**
- Complexity: LOW ("update", "styling")
- Risk: MEDIUM ("login page" - frontend only)
- Decision: DON'T COACH

**Expected Behavior:**
No coaching message. Proceed directly with task.

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Low complexity correctly avoids coaching (not annoying)

---

## Test 6: Documentation Task (Should NOT Coach)

**User Input:** "Add comments to explain this function"

**Expected Detection:**
- Complexity: LOW ("add comments")
- Risk: LOW ("documentation")
- Decision: DON'T COACH

**Expected Behavior:**
No coaching message. Proceed directly with task.

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Low risk correctly avoids coaching

## Test 7: Medium Complexity + Medium Risk (RARELY Coach)

**User Input:** "Refactor the dashboard component structure"

**Expected Detection:**
- Complexity: MEDIUM ("refactor")
- Risk: MEDIUM ("dashboard component" - frontend)
- Decision: RARELY_COACH (threshold check)

**Expected Behavior:**
- If user has good track record → Skip coaching
- If user has history of issues with refactoring → Light suggestion

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Medium/medium correctly uses adaptive threshold

---

## Test 8: User Declines Coaching Twice

**Scenario:**
1. First coaching: User selects [No, I'll skip]
2. Log outcome: declined
3. Similar task again within session
4. Expected: Don't repeat same coaching

**Expected Behavior:**
After 2 declines for same principle, back off and let user proceed.

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Anti-pattern avoided (not nagging)

---

## Test 9: User Applies Principle Independently

**Scenario:**
User message: "Let me run /sm:audit first to measure current quality, then I'll optimize"

**Expected Detection:**
- User already applying "measure first" principle
- Decision: DON'T COACH (already internalized!)

**Expected Behavior:**
No coaching. Log positive outcome: "User applied principle independently."

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Success state recognized (principle internalization)

---

## Test 10: Complex Architectural Decision

**User Input:** "Thinking about migrating from monolith to microservices architecture"

**Expected Detection:**
- Complexity: HIGH ("migrating", "architecture")
- Risk: CRITICAL ("architectural decision" - affects entire system)
- Decision: STRONGLY_RECOMMEND /sm:introspect

**Expected Coaching:**
```
⚠️ **Major Change Detected: Question First**

**What you're planning:** "Migrate from monolith to microservices"

**🚨 Risk Assessment:**
- **Complexity:** High (architectural migration)
- **System-Wide Risk:** Critical
- **Recommendation:** /sm:introspect before committing

[Show data about architectural migrations with vs without introspection]
[Emphasize: This is a 6-12 month decision]
[Offer Yes/No/Why options]

## Effectiveness Tracking Tests

### Test 11: Log Coaching Outcomes

**After each coaching interaction, verify Chroma logging:**

```javascript
{
  "documents": ["Coached /sm:introspect for auth rewrite, user accepted, ..."],
  "metadatas": {
    "type": "coaching",
    "command_suggested": "/sm:introspect",
    "reason": "high_complexity_critical_risk",
    "complexity": "high",
    "risk": "critical",
    "user_response": "accepted",
    "outcome": "[pending/success/failure]",
    "principle": "question_before_building"
  }
}
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - All coaching logged correctly

---

### Test 12: Calculate Acceptance Rate

**After 10 coaching interactions, query Chroma:**

```
Query: "coaching interactions"
Aggregate: user_response field
Calculate: (accepted / total) * 100

Target: >60% acceptance rate
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Metrics queryable from Chroma

---

### Test 13: Adaptive Learning

**Scenario:**
- Auth component prompts: 100% acceptance
- UI component prompts: 30% acceptance

**Expected Adaptation:**
- Increase coaching threshold for UI components
- Maintain aggressive coaching for auth

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - System learns from effectiveness data

---

## Integration Tests

### Test 14: Integration with quality-gate

**Scenario:**
1. User tries to commit without measuring
2. quality-gate pre-commit hook fails
3. smart-mcp-coach activates: "Remember: measure first"

**Expected Flow:**
```
git commit -m "optimization"
→ quality-gate runs
→ No baseline audit found
→ Commit blocked
→ smart-mcp-coach: "This is why we measure first (Principle 1)"
```

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Reinforces "measure first" principle

---

### Test 15: Integration with context-builder

**Scenario:**
1. context-builder gathers deep project context
2. User asks complex question
3. smart-mcp-coach has more evidence from context

**Expected Behavior:**
Coaching messages include deeper historical patterns from enhanced context.

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - More evidence = better coaching

---

## Edge Cases

### Test 16: Ambiguous Complexity

**User Input:** "Make the system better"

**Expected Detection:**
- Complexity: UNCLEAR
- Risk: UNCLEAR
- Default: MEDIUM complexity, MEDIUM risk
- Decision: Maybe ask clarifying question before coaching

**Test Result:** ✅ PASS - Handles ambiguity gracefully

---

### Test 17: Multiple Risk Components

**User Input:** "Refactor the auth API to use new payment processing"

**Expected Detection:**
