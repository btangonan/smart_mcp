- Existing code: YES (auth module is "working")
- Complexity: Moderate (authentication is critical)
- Risk: High (breaking working functionality)

**Tool Suggested**: `/sm:refactor`
**Confidence Score**: 0.95 (High - clear refactoring scenario)

**Reasoning Provided**:
> "This is a refactoring task. Your authentication module works but needs code quality improvement.
>
> **Why /sm:refactor**: You need systematic safety while improving working code. /sm:refactor provides:
> - Golden-master testing (captures current behavior)
> - Surgical changes (safe incremental improvements)
> - Fitness functions (automated quality checks)
> - Rollback safety (revert if issues)
>
> **Evidence from Chroma**: Refactoring with methodology shows 60%+ time savings vs ad-hoc changes, and quality scores improve from ~6.5 to 8.5+.
>

**Confidence Score**: 0.88 (High - clear decision scenario)

**Reasoning Provided**:
> "This is a high-impact architectural decision that needs validation BEFORE committing.
>
> **Why /sm:introspect FIRST**: Test assumptions and explore alternatives before deciding. Provides:
> - Naive-agent perspective (reset situational bias)
> - Assumption identification and testing
> - Alternative hypothesis generation (at least 3 options)
> - Blind spot analysis
> - Evidence-based soundness scoring
>
> **Then /sc:design**: Once you've validated the approach with /sm:introspect, use /sc:design to create the architecture.
>
> **Evidence from Chroma**: /sm:introspect prevents over-engineering 75%+ of the time, saves ~40% implementation time, and reduces regret by catching flawed assumptions early.
>
> **Key Principle**: 'Question before building' - major decisions need validation."

**Evidence Shown**:
- ✅ Over-engineering prevention (75%+)
- ✅ Time savings (40%)

- Workflow needed: Full implementation cycle

**Tool Suggested**: `/sc:implement`
**Confidence Score**: 0.93 (High - clear new feature scenario)

**Reasoning Provided**:
> "This is new feature development requiring a complete workflow.
>

> - Auto-activation of domain personas (frontend architect, security, quality)
> - Complete workflow coordination
> - Framework-specific best practices (via Context7 MCP)
> - Quality validation integration
>
> **Evidence from Chroma**: /sc:implement shows ~85% first-time success rate, average audit scores of 8.2/10, and 50% less rework vs manual implementation.
>
> **Components Detected**: This will likely use:
> - Form validation (edit capabilities)
> - File upload (avatar)
> - Dark mode toggle (theme switching)
> - Profile data management
>

> - Maturity scoring (0-10 scale, need ≥8.0 for production)
> - Security validation (critical for payments)
> - Performance analysis
> - Maintainability assessment
> - Trend tracking (improving or declining?)
>
> **Evidence from Chroma**: Projects using /sm:audit show 60% fewer production issues, 40% faster code reviews, and 90% compliance with quality standards.
>
> **Standard Enforcement**: Payment processing should score ≥8.5/10 (higher than normal ≥8.0) due to security and financial risk.
