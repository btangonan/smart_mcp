Improve structure, clarity, and testability without changing behavior.\n\nGOAL\n\nIdentify and prioritize refactors that reduce complexity, improve naming, strengthen separation of concerns, and raise testability\u2014while maintaining backward compatibility where possible.\n\nNON-NEGOTIABLES (Vibe Rules)\n\n\u2264300 LOC/file (500 max), single responsibility per file\n\nStrong types + schema validation at API/IO edges\n\nNo secrets in code/logs; env + secret manager only\n\nMinimal process state; durable truth in DB/object store\n\nStructured errors (Problem+JSON or eqv), retries/backoff, idempotency preserved\n\nSCOPE (auto-detect hotspots)\n\nFocus on largest/most complex files and modules with high churn/duplication.\n\nPrefer extracting pure core logic from I/O. Keep diffs tiny and auditable.\n\nTASKS\n\nFind Code Smells & Anti-Patterns\n\nLong files/functions, deep nesting, duplication, feature envy, temporal coupling, global mutable state, boolean flag params.\n\nProduce docs/refactor/smells.md with file:line and 1-line rationale.\n\nBetter Abstractions & SoC\n\nMove business rules to src/core/* (pure), I/O to src/adapters/*, composition/DI/routes to src/app/*.\n\nIntroduce narrow ports/interfaces around SDKs/clients; inject in app layer.\n\nDesign Patterns (only where it pays)\n\nStrategy for pluggable algorithms; Adapter for external SDKs; Factory for env-driven setup; Pipeline for staged transforms.\n\nAdd 1\u20132 line comment per pattern with reason.\n\nNaming & Clarity\n\nIntent-revealing names: nouns for data, verbs for actions, plurals for collections.\n\nRemove ambiguous abbreviations; prefer explicit params over flags.\n\nReduce Complexity \u2192 Improve Testability\n\nSplit functions (>20 lines, >5 params, \u22653 branches) into small pure helpers.\n\nKeep side-effects in adapters; core stays pure.\n\nBackward Compatibility\n\nPreserve public signatures and response shapes; if change is unavoidable, add shims + deprecation notes.\n\nMaintain idempotency keys, error shape, and retries.\n\nSECRET SAUCE (light but powerful)\n\nGolden-Master Characterization: Before changes, snapshot inputs\u2192outputs for top routes/CLI. Compare byte-for-byte post-refactor.\n\nFitness Functions (CI):\n\nLOC gate: fail if any file >300 LOC.\n\nDependency rule: forbid src/core importing from src/adapters.\n\nError shape lock: assert Problem+JSON fields on 4xx/5xx.\n\nPublic API snapshot: schema diff must be zero.\n\nStrangler Shim: Build new pure module; route old entry points through a shim to the new path; remove old code only after parity passes.\n\nObservability: Add structured logs around old vs new paths with correlationId; count mismatches during shadow runs.\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA\n\n\u2713 Behavioral parity: golden-master/contract tests pass.\n\n\u2713 File size limits respected; SRP improved (noted in smells.md).\n\n\u2713 Public APIs unchanged (or shims present); Problem+JSON shape intact.\n\n\u2713 Idempotency keys and retry logic preserved.\n\n\u2713 New/updated tests for extracted pure logic; \u226580% coverage on touched files.\n\n\u2713 Lint/format/typecheck/fitness functions pass.\n\n\u2713 Docs updated: docs/refactor/CHANGELOG.md (\u226420 lines).\n\nOUTPUTS\n\nMinimal PR diff (refactor + tests + doc delta).\n\ndocs/refactor/smells.md \u2014 smells & resolutions (before/after bullets).\n\ndocs/refactor/decisions.md \u2014 patterns chosen + rationale (\u226420 lines).\n\n(If used) docs/refactor/golden-master/ fixtures & parity report.\n\nSUGGESTED SELF-CALLS\n\n/sc:analyze --code --complexity --dup \u2192 pick 1\u20132 hotspots.\n\n/sc:test --record contracts \u2192 build golden-master fixtures.\n\n/sc:lint --fix && /sc:typecheck && /sc:test --run changed \u2192 parity check.\n\n(Optional) /sc:design --api --snapshot \u2192 public API schema snapshot.\n\nCHECKS BEFORE SUBMIT\n\nZero public API breaks (or shims + deprecation note).\n\nStructured error shape and status codes unchanged.\n\nNo new cross-request in-memory state.\n\nIdempotency preserved and tested (double-invoke does not duplicate work).\n\nFitness functions green; shadow mismatch counter == 0.\n\nSTYLE\n\nSmall, composable functions; early returns over deep nesting; explicit types at module boundaries; comments only where intent isn't obvious."
