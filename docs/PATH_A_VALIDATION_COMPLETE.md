## Key Strengths Identified

### 1. Evidence-Based Routing
- Every recommendation backed by Chroma data
- No "I think" or speculative suggestions
- Rich metrics across all scenarios

### 2. Teaching Orientation
- Doesn't just route - teaches the decision framework
- Progressive learning approach (Stages 1-4)
- Goal is user independence, not dependency

### 3. Risk-Appropriate Recommendations
- Adjusts quality standards based on criticality
- Example: Payment processing ≥8.5 vs standard ≥8.0
- Higher confidence for high-risk decisions

### 4. Alternative Provision
- Always offers alternatives or next steps
- Prevents single-path dependency
- Clarifies ambiguity before routing

### 5. Clear Confidence Scoring
- Transparent confidence levels (0.88-0.95 range)
- Guides user certainty
- Low confidence triggers clarifying questions
