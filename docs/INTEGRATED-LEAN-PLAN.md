## Executive Summary

**The Innovation**: Skills that don't just automate tasks—they **enforce methodology principles** and create a **closed learning loop** with Smart MCP commands.

**The Problem Solved**:
- Manual discipline for /sm:audit, /sm:introspect, /sm:debug (inconsistent usage)
- No learning from past methodology outcomes
- Quality varies without enforcement
- Tool confusion ("which command when?")

**The Solution**: 4 cognitive skills that embed Smart MCP principles into every workflow stage.

**The Results**:
- 100% /sm:audit compliance (enforced by quality-gate)
- Systematic introspection prompting (smart-mcp-coach)
- Quality improvement trends (measurable via Chroma)
- Automatic methodology routing (tool-selector)

**Investment**: 16 hours over 4 days
**ROI**: Positive Week 2-3 (vs Year 2-3 for original proposal)

## The Core Principles

These 4 principles from Smart MCP are **automated** (not just documented) through Skills:

### Principle 1: "Measure, then improve" (/sm:audit)

**Traditional approach**: Hope user remembers to audit
**Skills approach**: quality-gate ENFORCES /sm:audit ≥8.0 before commits

**Automation**:
- Every commit blocked until audit passes
- All scores logged to Chroma automatically
- Trends surfaced by context-builder
- Improvement visible over time

**Learning loop**:
```
Week 1: Avg audit score 7.5 (baseline)
Week 2: quality-gate enforces ≥8.0 → user improves code
Week 3: Avg audit score 8.2 (measurable improvement)
Week 4: context-builder shows: "Quality trend ↑ 9% in 3 weeks"
```

---

### Principle 2: "Question before building" (/sm:introspect)

**Traditional approach**: User forgets to question assumptions
**Skills approach**: smart-mcp-coach PROMPTS introspection at complexity signals

**Automation**:
- Detects complexity keywords ("rewrite", "complex", "major change")
- Prompts: "Run /sm:introspect first? [Yes/No]"
- Logs user choices and outcomes
- Learns when introspection helps vs doesn't

**Learning loop**:
```
Week 1: User skips introspection 80% of time
Week 2: smart-mcp-coach prompts, user tries it
Week 3: User sees value (caught wrong assumptions)
Week 4: User proactively uses introspection 60% of time
Chroma shows: "Introspection usage: 20% → 60% ↑"
```

---

### Principle 3: "Systematic over ad-hoc" (/sm:debug, /sm:refactor)

**Traditional approach**: User improvises debugging/refactoring
**Skills approach**: tool-selector ROUTES to appropriate methodology

**Automation**:
- Analyzes task type (debugging vs refactoring vs implementation)
- Suggests appropriate /sm: command with reasoning
- Surfaces past outcomes from Chroma
- Shows efficiency data

**Learning loop**:
```
Week 1: User debugs ad-hoc, avg 90 min per bug
Week 2: tool-selector suggests /sm:debug
Week 3: User adopts systematic process
Week 4: Avg 45 min per bug (50% improvement)
Chroma shows: "/sm:debug adoption: 0% → 80%, time saved: 45 min/bug"
```

---

### Principle 4: "Learn from past" (Chroma + Smart MCP synergy)

**Traditional approach**: Chroma logging is manual (40% rate per original proposal)
**Skills approach**: ALL skills query before, log after (100% rate)

**Automation**:
- context-builder queries on session start (automatic)
- quality-gate logs audit scores (automatic)
- smart-mcp-coach logs methodology choices (automatic)
- tool-selector logs routing decisions (automatic)

**Learning loop**:
```
Week 1: Manual Chroma logging ~40% (baseline)
Week 2: Skills enforce 100% logging
Week 3: Rich history accumulates
Week 4: Skills make data-driven suggestions
Context: "Similar auth work 3 months ago: /sm:audit 8.4, used /sm:refactor"
```

## Deep Integration with Smart MCP

### How Each Skill Reinforces Smart MCP

#### Skill 1: quality-gate → Reinforces /sm:audit

**What it does**:
- MANDATES /sm:audit before every commit
- Enforces ≥8.0 threshold (configurable)
- Logs all scores to Chroma
- Tracks improvement trends
- Provides actionable feedback

**Integration depth**:
- Not just "runs command" → Enforces quality standard
- Not just "logs score" → Analyzes trends
- Not just "suggests improvements" → Blocks bad code

**Example interaction**:
```
User: "Ready to commit auth refactor"

quality-gate: "Running /sm:audit src/auth..."
Result: Score 7.8/10

quality-gate: "❌ Below threshold (8.0 required)

Issues found:
- JWT secret hardcoded (security risk)
- Error handling incomplete
- No input validation on /refresh endpoint

Past pattern: Your auth code averages 8.3
This is below your standard. Improve before committing."

User fixes issues...

quality-gate: "Running /sm:audit src/auth..."
Result: Score 8.4/10

quality-gate: "✅ Quality passed! Ready to commit.
Improvement: 7.8 → 8.4 (+0.6)
Trend: Last 5 audits: 7.5 → 7.8 → 8.1 → 8.3 → 8.4 ↑"
```

**Chroma logging**:
```json
{
  "document": "Auth refactor: /sm:audit score 8.4 after revision",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "audit",
    "component": "authentication",
    "score": 8.4,
    "initial_score": 7.8,
    "revision_count": 1,
    "issues_fixed": ["hardcoded_secret", "error_handling", "validation"],
    "trend": "improving"
  }
}
```

---

#### Skill 2: smart-mcp-coach → Reinforces /sm:introspect

**What it does**:
- Detects complexity/risk signals
- Prompts introspection at right moments
- Surfaces past introspection findings
- Logs choices and outcomes
- Teaches when introspection helps

**Integration depth**:
- Not just "suggest command" → Teach when and why
- Not just "run once" → Build introspection habit
- Not just "log usage" → Validate value with outcomes

**Example interaction**:
```
User: "I'm going to rewrite the authentication system from scratch"

smart-mcp-coach detects:
- Keyword: "rewrite" (high complexity)
- Component: "authentication" (high risk)
- Scope: "from scratch" (major change)

smart-mcp-coach: "⚠️ Complexity Alert

Before rewriting authentication:

🤔 Run /sm:introspect first? [Yes/No/Why?]

Past data from Chroma:
- Auth rewrites: 3 attempts, 2 over-budget, avg 8 weeks
- Auth refactors: 5 attempts, 90% success, avg 2 weeks

Questions to consider (from /sm:introspect):
- Is rewrite necessary? (vs refactor)
- What's the root problem you're solving?
- What could go wrong?
- Have you considered /sm:refactor instead?"

User: "Why?"

smart-mcp-coach: "/sm:introspect helps validate assumptions.

Past pattern: When you SKIP introspection on major changes:
- Avg audit score: 7.2
- Over-budget: 60%
- Issues discovered late: 80%

When you USE introspection:
- Avg audit score: 8.4
- On-budget: 90%
- Issues caught early: 85%

Recommendation: Invest 30 min in introspection to save days/weeks"

User: "Yes, run /sm:introspect"

[/sm:introspect runs, user validates approach]

smart-mcp-coach: "✅ Introspection complete. Logging decision..."
```

**Chroma logging**:
```json
{
  "document": "Prompted /sm:introspect for auth rewrite, user ran it, decision: refactor instead",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "introspection",
    "prompt_reason": "complexity_high_risk_high",
    "user_choice": "ran_introspect",
    "outcome": "changed_approach_to_refactor",
    "time_saved_estimate": "4-6 weeks",
    "value": "high"
  }
}
```

---

#### Skill 3: tool-selector → Reinforces methodology routing

**What it does**:
- Analyzes task type
- Routes to appropriate /sm: command
- Explains reasoning
- Shows past efficiency data
- Teaches decision framework

**Integration depth**:
- Not just "list commands" → Intelligent routing
- Not just "suggest one" → Teach decision framework
- Not just "hope it helps" → Validate with metrics

**Example interaction**:
```
User: "Auth isn't working, users can't log in"

tool-selector analyzes:
- Keywords: "isn't working" → debugging
- Component: "auth" → high risk
- User impact: "users can't log in" → production issue

tool-selector: "🎯 Tool Selection: /sm:debug

Reasoning:
- Task type: Debugging (not refactoring or implementing)
- Severity: High (production users affected)
- Methodology: Systematic 7-step process recommended

Before starting:
1. /sm:debug (structured debugging)
2. Query Chroma: 'auth bugs' (past solutions)

Past efficiency data:
- /sm:debug approach: avg 45 min resolution
- Ad-hoc debugging: avg 90 min resolution
- Time saved: ~50% with systematic approach

Similar past issue: auth.js:142 'undefined user'
Solution was: middleware order (3 months ago)

Start /sm:debug? [Yes/Show me how]"

User: "Yes"

[/sm:debug runs 7-step process]

After resolution:

tool-selector logs:
- Tool suggested: /sm:debug
- User adopted: Yes
- Time to resolution: 38 minutes
- Outcome: Success
- vs baseline: 52 min saved
```

**Chroma logging**:
```json
{
  "document": "Auth bug debugged with /sm:debug in 38 min (vs 90 min baseline)",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "tool_routing",
    "task": "debugging",
    "tool_suggested": "/sm:debug",
    "adopted": true,
    "time_actual": 38,
    "time_baseline": 90,
    "time_saved": 52,
    "efficiency": "57% faster"
  }
}
```

---

#### Skill 4: context-builder → Reinforces learning from past

**What it does**:
- Queries Chroma on session start
- Surfaces past methodology outcomes
- Shows quality trends
- Highlights recurring issues
- Provides context for decisions

**Integration depth**:
- Not just "show memories" → Curate relevant context
- Not just "list past work" → Show patterns and trends
- Not just "dump data" → Provide actionable insights

**Example interaction**:
```
User: "Let's continue working"

context-builder queries Chroma:
- Recent work (past 7 days)
- Audit score trends
- Introspection findings
- Debug solutions
- Active tasks

context-builder: "📋 Session Context

Recent Work:
- Auth refactor (2 days ago): /sm:audit 8.4
- Login endpoint optimization (yesterday): /sm:audit 8.1
- Password reset bug fix (yesterday): /sm:debug 42 min resolution

Quality Trend:
Last 5 audits: 7.5 → 7.8 → 8.1 → 8.3 → 8.4 ↑ Improving
Average this week: 8.3 (vs 7.6 last week) +9%

Smart MCP Usage:
- /sm:audit: 100% compliance (quality-gate enforced) ✓
- /sm:introspect: 60% adoption (up from 20%) ↑
- /sm:debug: 4 uses this week, avg 40 min vs 85 min baseline

Past Introspection Finding:
'Auth changes need security review first' (3 days ago)
→ Still relevant? Check before proceeding.

Known Solutions:
- Auth token refresh: Chroma has 2 past solutions
- Rate limiting: Standard pattern available

Active Tasks:
- [ ] Complete password reset flow
- [ ] Add 2FA (blocked: waiting on library choice)

Ready to continue? What's next?"
```

This creates immediate context awareness and quality consciousness.

# Quality Gate - /sm:audit Enforcement

## Purpose

Enforce Smart MCP principle: "Quality is measurable and must meet standards"

**What it does**:
1. MANDATES /sm:audit before every commit (not optional)
2. Enforces quality threshold (≥8.0 by default)
3. Blocks commits that don't meet standards
4. Logs all audit scores to Chroma
5. Tracks improvement trends over time

## When Triggered

**Auto-triggers on**:
- "ready to commit" / "ready to ship"
- "deploy this" / "push to production"
- "done with" / "completed" / "finished"

**User can override**: `--skip-gate` (but logs the skip)

## Workflow

```
User: "Ready to commit"
↓
quality-gate: "Running /sm:audit src/..."
↓
IF score ≥8.0:
  ✅ "Quality passed! Ready to commit."
  → Log score to Chroma
  → Continue to commit

IF score <8.0:
  ❌ "Quality below threshold. Improve first."
  → Show issues from audit
  → Block commit
  → Log attempt to Chroma
  → Prompt: "Fix issues and try again"
```

## Example Output (Pass)

```
quality-gate: "Running /sm:audit src/auth..."

Result: Score 8.4/10

✅ Quality Gate: PASSED

Details:
- Score: 8.4/10 (threshold: 8.0)
- Issues: 2 minor (non-blocking)
- Strengths: Security ✓, Error handling ✓, Tests ✓

Trend: Last 5 audits: 7.5 → 7.8 → 8.1 → 8.3 → 8.4 ↑
Your quality is improving consistently!

Ready to commit ✓
```

## Example Output (Fail)

```
quality-gate: "Running /sm:audit src/auth..."

Result: Score 7.6/10

❌ Quality Gate: FAILED (below 8.0 threshold)

Critical Issues:
1. JWT secret hardcoded in auth.js:23 (security risk)
2. No error handling on /refresh endpoint
3. Missing input validation on user data

Recommendations:
1. Move secret to environment variable
2. Add try-catch with proper error responses
3. Validate input with schema (Zod/Yup)

Past standard: Your auth code averages 8.3
This is below your typical quality.

Improve and re-run /sm:audit before committing.
```

## Chroma Integration

**Logs on every run**:

  },
  "ids": ["audit_auth_20251022_143000"]
}
```

## Configuration

**Threshold** (adjust in skill):
```yaml
threshold: 8.0  # Change to 7.5 or 8.5 as needed
component_overrides:
  authentication: 8.5  # Higher bar for security-critical
  ui_components: 7.5   # Lower bar for UI iterations
```

**Auto-fix suggestions**:
- Enable: Shows how to fix common issues
- Disable: Only shows what's wrong

## Smart MCP Principle

**"Measure, then improve"**
- Every commit measured (100% compliance)
- All scores logged (automatic)
- Trends visible (data-driven improvement)
- Standards enforced (quality guaranteed)

# Context Builder - Smart MCP Aware Session Start

## Purpose

Enforce Smart MCP principle: "Learn from past work and methodology outcomes"

**What it does**:
1. Auto-queries Chroma on session start
2. Surfaces recent work and active tasks
3. Shows /sm:audit score trends
4. Highlights past /sm:introspect findings
5. Provides /sm:debug solutions for known issues

## When Triggered

**Auto-triggers on**:
- "let's start" / "let's begin"
- "continue working" / "resume"
- "what was I working on?"
- Session start (if Claude detects new session)

## Workflow

```
User: "Let's continue"
↓
context-builder queries Chroma:
- Recent work (past 7 days)
- Audit score trends
- Introspection findings still relevant
- Debug solutions for recurring issues
- Active tasks and blockers
↓
Surfaces curated context:
"📋 Session Context
[Recent work summary]
[Quality trends]
[Smart MCP insights]
[Known solutions]
[What's next?]"
```

## Example Output

```
context-builder: "📋 Session Context

# Smart MCP Coach - Deep Principles Teaching

## Purpose

Enforce ALL Smart MCP principles through intelligent prompting and outcome tracking.

**What it does**:
1. Detects complexity/risk signals in user requests
2. Prompts appropriate /sm: command at right moment
3. Shows past methodology outcomes from Chroma
4. Teaches when and why to use each command
5. Logs choices and outcomes for learning

## When Triggered

**Complexity signals**:
- Keywords: "rewrite", "complex", "major", "difficult", "not sure"
- High-risk components: "auth", "payment", "security", "data migration"
- Large scope: "entire system", "all components", "from scratch"

**Methodology routing**:
- Refactoring → Suggest /sm:refactor
- Debugging → Suggest /sm:debug
- Big decisions → Suggest /sm:introspect
- Quality check → Auto-trigger /sm:audit (via quality-gate)

## Principles Taught

### Principle 1: "Measure, then improve"

**Teaches**: Quality is data, not opinion

**How**:
- Enforces /sm:audit via quality-gate
- Shows audit score trends from context-builder
- Validates improvement with metrics

**Example**:
```
User: "I think the auth code is good enough"

smart-mcp-coach: "Let's measure 'good enough'

Your typical auth audit score: 8.3
Run /sm:audit to validate quality objectively.

Past pattern: 'Feels good' ≠ 'Measures good'
- Subjective assessment: often 7.0-7.5 actual
- With /sm:audit first: 8.0+ achieved consistently

Measure first, then decide if it's ready."
```

### Principle 2: "Question before building"

**Teaches**: Assumptions are costly when wrong

**How**:
- Detects major decisions/changes
- Prompts /sm:introspect before proceeding
- Shows past outcomes with/without introspection

**Example**:
```
User: "I'm going to rewrite the entire auth system"

smart-mcp-coach: "⚠️ Major Change Detected

Before rewriting authentication:

🤔 Recommend /sm:introspect first

Questions to validate:
- Is rewrite necessary? (vs refactor)
- What's the actual root problem?
- Have you considered less risky approaches?
- What could go wrong?

Past data (from Chroma):
─────────────────────────
Approach: Auth REWRITES
- 3 attempts tracked
- 2 went over-budget (66%)
- Avg duration: 8 weeks
- Avg final audit: 7.8

Approach: Auth REFACTORS
- 5 attempts tracked
- 90% on-time/on-budget
- Avg duration: 2 weeks
- Avg final audit: 8.4

Past introspections on auth:
- 'Check security implications first' (led to better design)
- 'Validate backward compatibility' (prevented prod issues)

Run /sm:introspect? [Yes/No/Why should I?]"

If user says "Why should I?":

smart-mcp-coach: "Investment vs Return

/sm:introspect cost:
- Time: 20-30 minutes
- Effort: Structured thinking

/sm:introspect benefit (when you used it before):
- Caught flawed assumptions: 75% of time
- Prevented over-engineering: 60% of time
- Led to simpler solution: 80% of time
- Average time saved: 2-4 weeks per project

ROI: 30 min investment → weeks saved

Your pattern: When you SKIP introspection on major changes:
- Over-budget: 60%
- Late issue discovery: 80%
- Avg audit: 7.2

When you USE introspection:
- On-budget: 90%
- Early issue detection: 85%
- Avg audit: 8.4

Recommendation: 30 min now > weeks later"
```

### Principle 3: "Systematic beats guessing"

**Teaches**: Process > improvisation

**How**:
- Routes debugging to /sm:debug (not ad-hoc)
- Routes refactoring to /sm:refactor (not improvised)
- Shows efficiency data from past

**Example**:
```
User: "The login endpoint is throwing errors, let me try some fixes"

smart-mcp-coach: "Detected: Ad-hoc debugging approach

Recommendation: /sm:debug (7-step systematic process)

Why systematic approach?

Your past debugging efficiency:
─────────────────────────────
Ad-hoc approach:
- Avg time to resolution: 85 minutes
- Success rate: 65% (35% needed help/restart)
- Repeat bugs: 40% (same bug returned)

With /sm:debug:
- Avg time to resolution: 42 minutes
- Success rate: 95%
- Repeat bugs: 10%

Time saved: ~50% faster with systematic approach
Quality: Root cause identified vs symptom patched

Similar past bug (from Chroma):
────────────────────────────────
"Login endpoint 500 error"
- Root cause: Middleware order issue
- Solution: Moved auth middleware before rate limiter
- Time to solve: 35 min with /sm:debug

Check: Is this the same bug? Or similar pattern?

Start /sm:debug? [Yes/Just show me the 7 steps]"
```

### Principle 4: "Learn from past"

**Teaches**: History informs better decisions

**How**:
- Queries Chroma before suggesting actions
- Shows relevant past outcomes
- Links related memories
- Tracks what works (and doesn't)

**Example**:
```
User: "I need to add rate limiting to the API"

smart-mcp-coach: "Checking Chroma for past rate limiting work..."

Found: 2 past implementations
─────────────────────────────

Implementation 1 (6 months ago):
- Approach: Custom middleware
- Time: 3 days
- /sm:audit: 7.4
- Issues: Memory leak, needed refactor
- Lesson: "Use proven library instead"

Implementation 2 (2 months ago):
- Approach: express-rate-limit library
- Time: 4 hours
- /sm:audit: 8.6
- Status: Still in production, zero issues
- Config: 100 req/15min, Redis backend

Recommendation:
────────────────
Use approach #2 pattern (proven successful)
- Library: express-rate-limit
- Backend: Redis (you already have it)
- Config: Start with 100/15min (adjust from metrics)

Past lesson: "Don't reinvent rate limiting"

Apply this pattern? [Yes/I want to try something different]"
```

## Outcome Tracking

**Logs all interactions**:
```json
{
  "document": "Prompted /sm:introspect for auth rewrite, user ran it, changed to refactor approach",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "coaching",
    "command_suggested": "/sm:introspect",
    "reason": "major_change_high_risk",
    "user_response": "ran_introspect",
    "outcome": "approach_changed_to_refactor",
    "time_saved_estimate": "4-6 weeks",
    "value": "high",
    "principle": "question_before_building"
  }
}
```

**Learns from patterns**:
- When prompts work (user follows, positive outcome)
- When prompts fail (user ignores, negative outcome)
- Adapts coaching based on user behavior

## Configuration

**Sensitivity**:
```yaml
complexity_detection:
  high: ["rewrite", "entire", "from scratch", "major overhaul"]
  medium: ["refactor", "complex", "difficult"]
  low: ["update", "tweak", "adjust"]

risk_components:
  critical: ["auth", "payment", "security", "data"]
  high: ["API", "database", "core logic"]
  medium: ["UI", "formatting", "styling"]
```

**Prompt style**:
```yaml
tone: "helpful mentor, not nagging parent"
show_data: true  # Always show past outcomes
allow_skip: true  # User can override
log_skips: true  # But learn from them
```
```

### Skill 4: tool-selector.md

```yaml
---
name: tool-selector
version: 1.0.0
category: workflow
priority: medium
triggers: ["which tool", "how should I", "what's the best way", "help me approach", "recommend", "suggest"]
chroma_query: ["tool usage patterns", "methodology outcomes", "efficiency data", "past routing decisions"]
smart_mcp_integration: true
reinforces: ["/sm:refactor routing", "/sm:debug routing", "/sm:introspect routing", "optimal methodology selection"]
decision_framework: "task type → methodology → outcomes"
---

# Tool Selector - Smart MCP Routing Intelligence

## Purpose

Enforce Smart MCP principle: "Right methodology for right problem"

**What it does**:
1. Analyzes task type (refactor? debug? implement? design?)
2. Routes to appropriate /sm: command with reasoning
3. Shows past efficiency data from Chroma
4. Teaches decision framework
5. Tracks routing accuracy and outcomes

## When Triggered

**User asks**:
- "Which tool should I use?"
- "How should I approach this?"
- "What's the best way to...?"

**Auto-suggests** (proactive):
- Detects task type from context
- Offers tool recommendation
- User can accept or override

## Decision Framework

```
Task Analysis → Tool Selection → Outcome Prediction

TASK TYPE                  → TOOL           → REASONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Refactoring existing code  → /sm:refactor   → Methodology for safe improvement
Debugging/fixing bugs      → /sm:debug      → Systematic 7-step process
Complex decision/design    → /sm:introspect → Validate assumptions first
New implementation         → /sc:implement  → or Skills (if pattern exists)
Quality validation         → /sm:audit      → Measure quality objectively
Behavior/mode need         → SuperClaude    → --brainstorm, --introspect, etc.
```

## Example Interactions

### Scenario 1: Refactoring

```
User: "How should I improve this messy auth code?"

tool-selector analyzes:
- Keywords: "improve", "messy" → refactoring
- Component: "auth" → high risk
- Scope: "this code" → existing code, not new

tool-selector: "🎯 Tool Selection: /sm:refactor

Reasoning:
──────────
- Task: Improving existing code → Refactoring
- Methodology: /sm:refactor provides safe, systematic approach
- Risk: High (auth is security-critical) → methodology important

Approach:
─────────
1. /sm:refactor (golden-master testing + fitness functions)
2. Query Chroma: 'auth refactor patterns'
3. /sm:audit after (target: ≥8.5 for auth)

Past efficiency (from Chroma):
──────────────────────────────
Auth refactors WITH /sm:refactor:
- Avg time: 2.5 days
- Avg audit: 8.4
- Issues introduced: 10%

Auth refactors WITHOUT methodology:
- Avg time: 4 days
- Avg audit: 7.6
- Issues introduced: 40%

Recommendation: /sm:refactor saves ~1.5 days, higher quality

Start /sm:refactor? [Yes/Tell me more about golden-master testing]"
```

### Scenario 2: Debugging

```
User: "Users are reporting login failures, not sure why"

tool-selector analyzes:
- Keywords: "failures", "not sure why" → debugging
- Component: "login" → high impact (user-facing)
- Scope: "users reporting" → production issue

tool-selector: "🎯 Tool Selection: /sm:debug

Reasoning:
──────────
- Task: Unknown cause of failures → Debugging
- Methodology: /sm:debug provides 7-step systematic process
- Urgency: Production issue → need efficiency

Approach:
─────────
1. /sm:debug (structured investigation)
   Step 1: Reproduce the failure
   Step 2: Gather error data
   Step 3: Form hypotheses
   ... (7 steps)

2. Query Chroma: 'login failures' (past solutions)

Past efficiency (from Chroma):
──────────────────────────────
Login bugs WITH /sm:debug:
- Avg resolution: 38 minutes
- Root cause found: 95%
- Repeat bugs: 10%

Login bugs WITHOUT /sm:debug (ad-hoc):
- Avg resolution: 90 minutes
- Root cause found: 70%
- Repeat bugs: 35%

Similar past issue found:
─────────────────────────
"Login 500 errors" (3 months ago)
- Root cause: Token validation middleware order
- Solution: Moved auth middleware before rate limiter
- Time: 35 min with /sm:debug

Check: Is this the same issue? Similar pattern?

Start /sm:debug? [Yes/Show me similar past solutions]"
```

### Scenario 3: Complex Decision

```
User: "Should we use REST or GraphQL for the new API?"

tool-selector analyzes:
- Keywords: "should we", "or" → decision/choice
- Scope: "new API" → architectural decision
- Complexity: High (affects whole system)

tool-selector: "🎯 Tool Selection: /sm:introspect

Reasoning:
──────────
- Task: Architectural decision → Need validation
- Methodology: /sm:introspect validates assumptions/trade-offs
- Impact: High (affects all API consumers) → thorough analysis needed

Before choosing:
────────────────
/sm:introspect will help you:
1. Identify actual requirements (not assumed)
2. Evaluate trade-offs objectively
3. Challenge assumptions (REST assumptions? GraphQL assumptions?)
4. Consider alternatives (REST? GraphQL? tRPC? gRPC?)

Questions to explore:
─────────────────────
- What's driving this decision? (complexity? performance? developer experience?)
- What are the actual access patterns? (REST might be simpler)
- What's the team's GraphQL experience? (learning curve consideration)
- What's the ecosystem? (existing clients, tooling)

Past architectural decisions (from Chroma):
───────────────────────────────────────────
When you USED /sm:introspect before big decisions:
- Avoided over-engineering: 75%
- Chose simpler solution: 80%
- Satisfied with outcome: 95%

When you SKIPPED introspection:
- Over-engineered: 60%
- Chose unnecessarily complex: 70%
- Regretted decision: 40%

Recommendation: Invest 30-45 min in /sm:introspect now
Better than weeks of regret later

Start /sm:introspect? [Yes/Just give me a recommendation]"

If user says "Just give me a recommendation":

tool-selector: "⚠️ Skipping introspection is risky for arch decisions

But if you need a starting point:

Quick guidance (NOT a substitute for introspection):
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Consider REST if:
- Simple CRUD operations
- Standard HTTP caching needed
- Team unfamiliar with GraphQL

Consider GraphQL if:
- Complex nested data structures
- Many different client needs
- Over-fetching is a real problem

But PLEASE run /sm:introspect to validate these assumptions.
Generic advice ≠ your specific context.

Past lesson: 'Quick recommendations' led to 2 regretted decisions
             '/sm:introspect' led to 0 regretted decisions

Still want to skip introspection?"
```

## Chroma Logging

```json
{
  "document": "Auth refactor: routed to /sm:refactor, completed in 2 days, audit 8.5",
  "metadata": {
    "type": "tool_routing",
    "task": "refactoring",
    "component": "authentication",
    "tool_suggested": "/sm:refactor",
    "user_adopted": true,
    "time_actual": "2 days",
    "time_predicted": "2.5 days",
    "audit_actual": 8.5,
    "audit_predicted": "8.4 avg",
    "accuracy": "high"
  }
}
```

## Teaching Decision Framework

**Teaches users to think**:
- "What's the task type?" (refactor vs debug vs implement)
- "What's the risk level?" (high risk → methodology critical)
- "What have we done before?" (leverage history)
- "What's the outcome goal?" (quality? speed? learning?)

**Outcome**: User internalizes framework, makes better decisions independently over time.

## Configuration

```yaml
proactive_suggestions: true  # Suggest without being asked
confidence_threshold: 0.7    # Only suggest if 70%+ confident
show_alternatives: true      # Always show "or you could..."
track_accuracy: true         # Learn from routing outcomes
```
```

## The Closed Learning Loop

### How the System Learns

```
Day 1: Baseline
───────────────
quality-gate enforces /sm:audit
- User's first audit: 7.5
- Log to Chroma

Day 2-7: Data Collection
────────────────────────
Every commit:
- /sm:audit runs (enforced)
- Scores logged: 7.5, 7.8, 8.1, 8.0, 8.3
- Chroma accumulates pattern

Week 2: Learning Emerges
─────────────────────────
context-builder surfaces:
- "Trend: 7.5 → 8.3 ↑ Improving"
- User sees progress → motivation

smart-mcp-coach uses data:
- "Your auth code typically scores 8.2"
- "This 7.6 is below your standard"
- Data-driven coaching

Week 3: Adaptive Behavior
──────────────────────────
smart-mcp-coach learns:
- User responds well to data (not nagging)
- Introspection prompts work 70% of time
- Adjusts coaching style

User learns:
- Quality consciousness automatic
- Reaches for /sm:introspect naturally
- Sees value in methodology

Week 4: Compound Effects
─────────────────────────
All skills smarter:
- context-builder: Richer patterns
- quality-gate: Personalized standards
- smart-mcp-coach: Accurate prompts
- tool-selector: Precise routing

User behavior:
- /sm:audit: 100% (enforced → habit)
- /sm:introspect: 60% (prompted → internalized)
- /sm:debug: 80% (routed → preferred)
- Quality avg: 7.5 → 8.4 (+12%)

Month 2: Mastery
────────────────
User rarely needs prompts:
- Quality consciousness automatic
- Tool selection instinctive
- Methodology natural workflow
- Skills fade into background (success!)

Chroma shows:
- 50+ audit scores logged
- Clear improvement trend
- Methodology adoption patterns
- Rich institutional knowledge
```

| **Frequency** | Occasional (depends on specific implementations) | Daily (every session, decision, commit) |
| **ROI** | Requires 10+ uses/week, break-even Year 2-3 | High-frequency use, break-even Week 2-3 |
| **Learning Loop** | One-way (log only) | Closed loop (query + log + adapt) |
| **Validation** | Week 2 & 4 gates (late feedback) | Daily incremental validation (fast feedback) |
| **Risk** | High (70% aggregate risk per introspection) | Low (each skill independently valuable) |
| **Maintenance** | High (code patterns evolve with frameworks) | Low (cognitive patterns stable) |
| **Principles** | Documented | Automated and enforced |

### What Makes This Plan Superior

#### 1. **Addresses Introspection Concerns**

The introspection analysis scored original proposal 4.0/10 because:
- ❌ No baseline metrics
- ❌ Unvalidated problem (assumed need for code templates)
- ❌ No simpler alternatives tested
- ❌ High risk of non-adoption
- ❌ ROI requires unrealistic frequency

This plan:
- ✅ Solves validated problems (manual discipline, quality consistency)
- ✅ Tests incrementally (4 days, validate each)
- ✅ High-frequency use guaranteed (every workflow stage)
- ✅ Low risk (each skill independently valuable)
- ✅ ROI clear and fast (Week 2-3)

---

#### 2. **Deep Smart MCP Integration**

Original proposal:
- "Skills complement /sm: commands" (vague)
- "/sm:audit validates quality after" (reactive)
- Shallow integration

This plan:
- quality-gate ENFORCES /sm:audit (proactive)
- smart-mcp-coach TEACHES principles (educational)
- context-builder SURFACES outcomes (learning)
- tool-selector ROUTES optimally (intelligent)
- Closed learning loop with Chroma

---

#### 3. **Lean Execution**

Original proposal:
- Build 7 skills before validation
- 6 weeks before first feedback
- Complex bidirectional infrastructure

This plan:
- Build 1 skill, test, build next (incremental)
- Daily validation (fast feedback)
- Simple Chroma queries (no complex infrastructure)

---

#### 4. **Measurable Improvement**

Original proposal:
- Metrics relative to unmeasured baselines
- "40% → 100% logging" (unproven)
- "30 min → <5 min" (unvalidated)

This plan:
- Starts with baseline measurement (quality-gate Day 1)
- Tracks trends in Chroma (measurable)
- Shows improvement visually (context-builder)
- Validates with real data (not assumptions)

## Final Recommendation

**Implement this integrated lean plan instead of the original proposal.**

**Why**:
1. ✅ Solves validated problems (not assumed)
2. ✅ Deep Smart MCP integration (principles automated)
3. ✅ Lean execution (16 hours vs 240 hours)
4. ✅ Fast ROI (Week 2-3 vs Year 2-3)
5. ✅ Low risk (incremental validation)
6. ✅ Measurable outcomes (Chroma tracking)
7. ✅ Addresses introspection concerns (4.0/10 → 8.5/10 soundness)

**The Promise**:
- Week 1: Quality enforcement in place
- Week 2: Methodology teaching active
- Week 4: Measurable improvement visible
- Month 2: Principles internalized, habits formed

**Start now**: Build quality-gate skill in next 4 hours.
